Feature: Checkpoint
  As a player,
  I want the checkpoint to turn and be moved only if it's mutable,
  but the laser beam to pass through it,
  only if it hits an opening side,
  which depends on direction.

  Background:
    # We always start from a fresh 5 x 5 board in these scenarios
    Given a new game is started
    And the board is initialized with width 5 and height 5
    And a completely mutable Checkpoint token is placed on the board at (2, 2) facing right


  # Checkpoint is movable and turnable
  Scenario: Checkpoint is movable
    Given I move the Checkpoint token to (3, 3)
    Then the Checkpoint token should be at (3, 3)

  Scenario: Checkpoint is turnable
    Given I turn the Checkpoint token to face down
    Then the Checkpoint token should face down

  # Laser travels in a straight line until it hits the opening side of the checkpoint
  Scenario: Laser hits non-opening side of a Checkpoint
    Given a completely mutable Laser token is placed on the board at (2, 4) facing up
    When I activate the laser
    And the laser forms a beam path
    Then the laser beam should pass through the following position directions:
      | x | y | dir |
      | 2 | 3 | UP |
      # Hits non-opening side of Checkpoint and stops

  # Laser travels in a straight line through the opening side of the checkpoint
  Scenario: Laser hits opening side of a Checkpoint
    Given a completely mutable Laser token is placed on the board at (2, 4) facing up
    And I turn the Checkpoint token to face down
    When I activate the laser
    And the laser forms a beam path
    Then the laser beam should pass through the following position directions:
      | x | y | dir |
      | 2 | 3 | UP |
      # Hits opening side of Checkpoint and goes through it
      | 2 | 2 | UP |
      # continues straight
      | 2 | 1 | UP |
      | 2 | 0 | UP |

  Scenario: Fire laser through opening side of a Checkpoint facing RIGHT
    Given a new game is started
    And the board is initialized with width 5 and height 5
    And a completely mutable Checkpoint token is placed on the board at (2, 2) facing RIGHT
    And a completely mutable Laser token is placed on the board at (0, 2) facing RIGHT
    When I activate the laser
    And the laser forms a beam path
    Then the laser beam should pass through the following position directions:
      | x | y | dir   |
      | 1 | 2 | RIGHT |
      | 2 | 2 | RIGHT |
      | 3 | 2 | RIGHT |
      | 4 | 2 | RIGHT |

  Scenario: Laser hits non-opening side of a Checkpoint facing UP
    Given a new game is started
    And the board is initialized with width 5 and height 5
    And a completely mutable Checkpoint token is placed on the board at (2, 2) facing UP
    And a completely mutable Laser token is placed on the board at (0, 2) facing RIGHT
    When I activate the laser
    And the laser forms a beam path
    Then the laser beam should pass through the following position directions:
      | x | y | dir   |
      | 1 | 2 | RIGHT |

  Scenario: Level beam passes through a vertical‚Äêopening checkpoint
    Given a new game is started
    And the level is initialized with id 1, required target number 0, a board with width 5 and height 5, and the following tokens:
      | token      | x | y | dir | turnable | movable | is required |
      | Checkpoint | 2 | 2 | UP  | false    | false   |             |
      | Laser      | 2 | 4 | UP  | false    | false   |             |
    When I activate the level's laser
    And the level's laser forms a beam path
    Then the beam path should pass through all checkpoints
    And the number of targets hit by the beam path should be 0
